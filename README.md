## Introduction
Dealing with PDF documents containing a wealth of information can be challenging. This application aims to simplify the process by providing a chatbot that answers your inquiries about the uploaded PDF documents. It leverages natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning models to extract  text, process the content, and provide answers. 

## Example

1. Upload one or more PDF documents using the file uploader.

2. Click the "Process" button to extract text from the PDFs and wait for the app to be ready.

3. In the main interface, enter a question related to the uploaded documents in the text input field.

4. Hit Enter to receive answers based on the content of the documents.

The chatbot will provide responses, and you can review the conversation history to track previous interactions.


## Requirements
Before running the code, you need to install the following Python libraries:

- streamlit
- PyPDF2
- langchain
